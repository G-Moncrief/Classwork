          Golly is an open source application for exploring cellular automata, the most famous of which is Conway's Game of Life. In this so called 'zero player game' the gameplay is determined by an initial state which is acted upon by a series of established rules and mathematical functions without additional input by the player.<br><br>

        <p>
          The board consists of a n x m grid of cells, which each have a finite number of states (typically on or off, aka alive or dead). Each cell has a set of cells called its neighborhood which define and are defined by each other's states. The user assigns an initial state at time t = 0 and for each advancement of t a new generation is created based off the fixed rules governing each cell.<br><br>

          While Golly allows users to load and modify rule sets, for this presentation we will focus primarily on Conway's Game of Life which was the first simulation to advance the ideas presented by Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann further than the field of academia.<br><br>
